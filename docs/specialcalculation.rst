Special Pyfrag Calculation
==========================

Besides the above simple calculations, it is more complicated to perform an open shell Activation Strain Analysis (ASA) using PyFrag 2019 for the technical reasons. For more information please check the example_ consisting of an analysis of the C-C single bond between two CP radicals in the four-atomic molecule PCCP.

Open Shell ASA

To submit a job, create a directory and generate a input file and run the following command to submit a job:

``pyfrag -x open job.in``


In order to perform a successful open shell fragment analysis, additional information should be provided in the following input blocks: ::

   fragment1 EXTRA

   SYMMETRY C(3V)
   CHARGE    0 0

   OCCUPATIONS
   E1 4
   A1 5
   END

   fragment1 EXTRA END

The fragment calculations used to provide the TAPE21 for the overall complex calculation
must be done, for technical reasons, in the restricted mode. The proper spins are then
specified in the calculation of the overall molecule using the FragOccupations key.
Noted a proper decomposition of an electron-pair bond energy requires specifying
opposite spins for the unpaired electrons of the respective radical fragments,
which can be done with the input key FragOccupations. For the convenience of the analysis,
it is suggested to specify the electronic configuration according to the symmtry of the molecule.

Please note that if one neglects explicitly specifying opposite spins for the
unpaired electrons of the fragments, each of them is treated as being half an
alpha and half a beta electron and consequently, they enter into a spurious
Pauli repulsive interaction. This results, among others, into the Pauli
repulsion term being too repulsive and the orbital interaction term being too
much stabilizing.

Note that this implies a slight approximation because the bond energy
computed in this way refers to the energy difference between complex
and two fragment radicals that are described by orbitals from a spin-restricted SCF
calculation, which have been given an unrestricted occupation. In other words, the
set of alpha- and beta-spin orbitals are identical and the effect of spin polarization is missing.
In practice, this leads to minor energy differences with respect to the correct
bond energy, that is, the energy difference between complex and two
fragment radicals treated in the unrestricted mode, i.e., for which the set of
alpha- and beta-spin orbitals are allowed to relax toward different solutions
in the SCF procedure.

This correction term can be computed directly by carrying out an unrestricted computation of the
fragment radical using the following block: ::

   fragment1 open EXTRA
   charge 0 1
   unrestricted
   fragment1 open EXTRA END

   fragment2 open EXTRA
   charge 0 1
   unrestricted
   fragment2 open EXTRA END

   complex open EXTRA
   charge 0 0
   complex open EXTRA END


After the calculation, all results will be summarized in two text files. One file with the name started with pyfrag1
include all terms obtained from the above open shell ASA.

The second file with the name started with pyfrag2 include the correction energy terms from the correction procedure later.


Open Shell ASA Orbital Energy
-----------------------------

Because the above open shell Activation Strain Analysis will not give the correct orbital energy of fragment,
thus, in order to extract the correct orbital energy, the following small calculation can be performed: ::


   PyFrag

   ircpath /Users/xiaobo/Desktop/test/plams.0001
   fragment  frag1open
   orbitalenergy  HOMO
   orbitalenergy  HOMO-1
   orbitalenergy  LUMO
   orbitalenergy  LUMO+1
   orbitalenergy  AA 5

   PyFrag END

The ircpath refer to the plams directory that contains all the open shell calculation results.
Besides, the fragment term specifies from which (fragment1open or fragment1open) orbital energy will be extracted.
Noted only one fragment informatin can be readed for one calculation.


To submit a job, create a directory and generate a input file and run the following command to run a job:

``pyfrag -x openorb job.in``


Single Points
-------------

The basic PyFrag 2019 input for the Activation Strain Analysis (ASA) using ADF to do single point calculation for a series of coordinates is as follows: ::

   JOBSUB

   #!/bin/bash
   #SBATCH -J NNC
   #SBATCH -N 1
   #SBATCH -t 1:00:00
   #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=24
   #SBATCH --partition=short
   #SBATCH --output=%job.stdout
   #SBATCH --error=%job.stdout
   export NSCM=24

   JOBSUB END

   PyFrag

   ircpath /Users/xiaobo/Desktop/test1/molecule.xyz

   VDD 1 2 3
   angle 1 2 3 90
   bondlength 1 2 5

   PyFrag END


   ADF

   basis
   type DZ
   core None
   end

   xc
   gga OPBE
   end

   scf
   iterations 99
   converge 0.0001
   mixing 0.20
   end

   numericalquality good

   ADF END


Note that the fragment definations are not needed. This functionality provide an easy way to do a simple single point calculation for a series of different molecular coordinates and get the computational results like VDD charges, total energy, bond length and angles. Use the following command to run this calculation:

``pyfrag -x single job.in``
