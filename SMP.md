# Software Maintenance Plan (SMP)

## 1. Purpose (under development)

The PyFrag 2019 program was specially designed to facilitate the analysis of reaction mechanism in a more efficient and user-friendly way. The original `PyFrag 2008`_workflow facilitated the characterization of reaction mechanisms in terms of the intrinsic properties, such as strain and interaction, of the reactants. This approach is routinely applied in the `Bickelhaupt Group`_ to understand numerous organic, inorganic, and biomolecular reactions/processes. The new PyFrag 2019  program has automated and reduced the time-consuming and laborious task of setting up, running, analyzing, and visualizing computational data from reaction mechanism studies to a single job. PyFrag 2019 resolves three main challenges associated with the automatized computational exploration of reaction mechanisms: 1) the management of multiple parallel calculations to automatically find a reaction path; 2) the monitoring of the entire computational process along with the extraction and plotting of relevant information from large amounts of data; and 3) the analysis and presentation of these data in a clear and informative way. The activation strain and canonical energy decomposition results that are generated, relate the characteristics of the reaction profile in terms of intrinsic properties (strain, interaction, orbital overlaps, orbital energies, populations) of the reactant species.

## 2. Engineering Focus

How will your software be packaged and distributed? Please
provide a link to available packaging information (e.g. entry in a
packaging registry, if available).

Via PyPI (<https://pypi.org/project/pyfrag/>)

### 2.3. Testing (under development)

How will your software be tested? Please provide a link to the
automated testing results.

Automated testing using GitHub actions

### 2.4. Software Engineering quality (under development)

Python code format guidelines: <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html>
Using for code linting and formatting Ruff (<https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff>) and Flake8 (<https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/tree/main>)
Use type annotations! (<https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html>)
